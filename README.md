# Real-Time-Joystick-Data-Collection-and-Transmission-with-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W-and-MicroPython
This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to collect joystick data, wirelessly transmit it via socket library, and display it on an LCD screen using MicroPython - all in real-time. 
Welcome to my latest project, where I have designed and implemented an advanced setup that utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W to retrieve and process data from an external joystick. With wireless communication capabilities using the socket library, the data is transmitted seamlessly in real-time to a client. This data is then presented on an LCD screen using MicroPython with precision and accuracy, demonstrating the full capabilities of the setup.

I am excited to add this impressive project to my Github portfolio and showcase my technical skills and knowledge in data collection and transmission. This project represents my dedication and commitment to staying ahead of the technological curve and creating innovative solutions for real-world applications.
